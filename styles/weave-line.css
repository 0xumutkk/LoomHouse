/* ======================================
   LOOM HOUSE — WEAVE LINE COMPONENT
   STAGE 3
   ====================================== */

/*
  This CSS file serves as documentation and reference
  for the WeaveLine component styling.
  
  The actual styles are implemented using styled-jsx
  within the WeaveLine.tsx component for better component
  encapsulation and Next.js optimization.
  
  Key Design Specifications:
  
  1. SVG Structure
     - ViewBox: 0 0 1200 140
     - Preserves aspect ratio: none (for full-width stretch)
     - Height: 140px (desktop), 120px (mobile)
  
  2. Organic Path
     - Complex Bezier curve with multiple control points
     - Asymmetric and irregular for hand-drawn feel
     - No harsh symmetry
     - Warm, gallery-like aesthetic
  
  3. Stroke Styling
     - Color: #1A1A1A (black lines)
     - Width: 2px
     - Caps: round
     - Joins: round
     - Vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke (maintains stroke width)
  
  4. Scroll-Linked Motion
     - Parallax-like effect using scroll position
     - Movement range: -8px to +8px (vertical)
     - Multiplier: scrollY * 0.04
     - Transition: 0.1s ease-out
     - Uses requestAnimationFrame for performance
     - Passive event listener
  
  5. Layout
     - Width: 100% with max-width 1200px
     - Centered horizontally
     - Margin-top: 100px (desktop), 80px (mobile)
     - Padding: 40px (desktop), 24px (mobile)
  
  6. Performance Optimizations
     - will-change: transform
     - Throttling via requestAnimationFrame
     - Passive scroll listener
     - Minimal repaints
  
  Design Philosophy:
  - Extremely subtle and non-intrusive
  - "Breathing" effect that enhances without distracting
  - Maintains warm gallery aesthetic
  - Lightweight with no external dependencies
  - Production-ready and performant
